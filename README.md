Basic Arithmetic Operations Program
This C++ program allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You can input two numbers and choose the operation you want to perform.

## Features:-
- Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on two numbers.
- Display the result of the selected operation.
- Supports integer and floating-point numbers for accurate calculations.

## How to Use:-
1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the arithmetic_operations.cpp file.

2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler. For example, you can use the g++ compiler as follows:
`g++ arithmetic_operations.cpp -o arithmetic_operations`

3. Run the program:
`./arithmetic_operations`

4. You will be prompted to choose an operation:
> Enter + for addition.
> Enter - for subtraction.
> Enter * for multiplication.
> Enter / for division.

5. After selecting an operation, follow the on-screen prompts to enter two numbers.

6. The program will perform the selected operation and display the result.

## Note:-
This program provides a basic demonstration of arithmetic operations and does not include error handling for division by zero or input validation for non-numeric inputs. You can enhance the program to include these features if needed. The program uses both integer and floating-point functions to handle different types of numbers accurately.
